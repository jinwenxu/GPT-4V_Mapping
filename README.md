This repository is dedicated to documenting all attempts, including intermediate results, to utilize GPT4-V for Map Reading and Analysis. We aim to explore the capabilities of the AI model in handling spatial data, generating relevant insights, and guiding the creation of geographic visualizations.

Through this process, we will illustrate the potential use cases of AI in the field of Geographic Information Science (GIS) and related domains. The details including step-by-step tutorials, code snippets, challenges faced, and solutions, were documented in the proposed manuscript.
