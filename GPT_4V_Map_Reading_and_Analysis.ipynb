However, the straight lines and the right angles introduce distortions, particularly in areas far from the equator, so this projection is not area-preserving and does not maintain true distances or angles. It's commonly used for wall maps and for some thematic maps where the distortion is not as critical to the representation of data.\n"

            "You've provided a map that appears to show a spatial distribution of two types of crimes (burglary and theft) across various levels of per capita income in an urban area. In this map, different colors represent different ranges of per capita income, with lighter colors indicating lower income levels and darker colors indicating higher income levels.

            "\n",
            "To determine which crime is more related to income, we would need to analyze the density of each crime type within each income bracket. A statistical analysis with more precise data (like a correlation coefficient or regression analysis) would provide clearer evidence to support whether and how strongly each crime type is related to income levels. However, based on this visual inspection, it appears that theft (green points) shows a somewhat stronger pattern of clustering in higher-income areas, suggesting that theft might be more related to income than burglary is, as it is more prevalent in wealthier neighborhoods on this map. But without a thorough statistical analysis, this remains a preliminary observation.\n"

            "These three maps are thematic representations of precipitation data across the contiguous United States for the period of January through December 2022. They are color-coded to indicate the amount of precipitation in different geographical divisions. Below are the differences among the maps:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Statewide Precipitation Map**\n",
            "   - The first map represents precipitation data at the statewide level.\n",
            "   - Each state is filled with a single color, which indicates the average precipitation level for the entire state.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Divisional Precipitation Map**\n",
            "   - The second map provides a more granular look at precipitation by dividing states into climate divisions.\n",
            "   - Each climate division within a state is color-coded individually, which allows for a more detailed understanding of precipitation variations within states.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **County Precipitation Map**\n",
            "   - The third map shows precipitation data at the county level, offering the highest granularity among the three maps.\n",
            "   - Each county within a state has its own distinct color coding, which reflects the precipitation amount specific to that county.\n",
            "\n",
            "The main differences between these maps are the scale and resolution of the data presented. As we move from the statewide to the county map, the level of detail increases, showing more localized patterns in precipitation variability. Each subsequent map provides a finer subdivision of the geographic area, which may be important for more localized weather analysis and understanding of weather impacts at a local to regional scale.\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, all three maps include a legend indicating the precipitation amount with corresponding color shades, as well as information on the bottom about the overall precipitation (28.46 inches), rank (27th driest), anomaly (-1.48 inches), and mean (29.94 inches) for the contiguous U.S. during the specified time frame. These statistics are consistent across the maps, providing a reference point for evaluating the data presented in the visualizations.\n"

            "3. **Eastern States**:\n",

            "4. **Midwestern States**:\n",
