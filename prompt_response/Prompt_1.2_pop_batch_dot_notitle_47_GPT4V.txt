The thematic map provided appears to be a dot distribution map, which is used to show the specific location and distribution of something across the territory of the mapâ€”in this case, population. Each dot represents a certain number of people, and the legend on the left side of the map indicates the value each dot represents (1K for 1,000 people, 10K for 10,000 people, etc.). The map is used to visualize the density and distribution of the population within the geographic area shown, which includes the city of Nashville as a labeled point of interest.
