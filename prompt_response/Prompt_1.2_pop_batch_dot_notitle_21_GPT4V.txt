The figure you've provided appears to be a dot distribution map, which is a type of thematic map. Dot distribution maps use dots to represent the presence, quantity, or value of a particular phenomenon or data point. In this case, the map is showing the distribution of population across a geographic area, with different sizes of dots representing different population brackets as indicated in the legend. The legend shows that the smallest dots represent populations of 1,000, larger dots represent 10,000, even larger dots represent 100,000, and the largest dots represent 1 million people.
