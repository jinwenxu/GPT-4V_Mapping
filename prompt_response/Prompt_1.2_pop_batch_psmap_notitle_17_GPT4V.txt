The thematic map provided is a proportional symbol map. This type of map uses symbols, such as circles in this case, of varying sizes to represent quantitative values of a particular theme or variable across a geographic area. Here, the size of the circles corresponds to the population of the locations marked on the map, with larger circles representing larger populations. The legend in the lower-left corner indicates the population sizes that correspond to the different circle sizes.
