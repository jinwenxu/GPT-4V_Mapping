The thematic map provided is a proportional symbol map. This type of map uses symbols, such as circles in this case, of different sizes to represent data quantities and show a statistical variable in proportion to the size of the symbol. The map legend indicates that the symbol sizes correspond to population levels, with larger circles representing larger populations. The map is focused on a specific geographic area, with latitude and longitude lines providing a grid reference, and it includes a notable location, Baton Rouge, marked with a blue dot.
