The map provided is a choropleth map, which uses differences in shading, coloring, or the placing of symbols within predefined areas to indicate the average values of a property or quantity in those areas. Here are the elements included in this map:

1. Title: "Choropleth Map of Population in Kansas Counties" - This indicates the subject of the map, which is the population distribution across counties in the state of Kansas.

2. Color Legend: A box in the lower left corner provides a key to the colors used on the map, correlating to population ranges:
   - Light yellow: Population less than 16.3K (thousand)
   - Light orange: Population between 16.3K and 39.0K
   - Orange: Population between 39.0K and 80.7K
   - Dark orange: Population between 80.7K and 177.9K
   - Red: Population greater than 177.9K

3. County Boundaries: The map shows the boundaries of the counties within Kansas.
