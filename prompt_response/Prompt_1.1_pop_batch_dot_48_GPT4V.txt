The map elements included in the given map are:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Texas Counties" at the top of the map.
2. Legend: A box in the lower-left corner that explains the population density symbols:
   - A small square for 1K (1,000 people)
   - A medium square for 10K (10,000 people)
   - A large square for 100K (100,000 people)
   - A filled square for 1M (1,000,000 people)
3. Scale: There is no explicit scale bar, but the map uses a dot density representation where the size of the squares corresponds to the number of people.
4. Latitude and Longitude markers: Along the borders of the map, indicating the geographical coordinates.
5. County boundaries: Outlines of counties in Texas.
6. City label: The name "Austin" is labeled in red, indicating the location of the city on the map.
7. Color coding: Different sizes of blue squares represent different population densities within the counties.

The map uses a dot density approach to visually represent the population distribution across the counties of Texas.
