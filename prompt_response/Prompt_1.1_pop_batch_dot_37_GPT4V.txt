The map you've provided is a dot density map showing the population distribution in North Carolina counties. Here are the map elements included in the given map:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in North Carolina Counties" at the top of the map, which describes the map's purpose and geographic focus.

2. Legend: In the lower left corner, there is a legend that explains the meaning of the dots on the map. It indicates that each dot represents a certain number of people, with different dot densities corresponding to 1K (1,000), 10K (10,000), 100K (100,000), and 1M (1,000,000) people.

3. Scale: There is no explicit scale bar, but the dot density serves as an indirect indicator of population scale.

4. Latitude and Longitude: The map includes latitude and longitude lines, with labels on the axes indicating degrees. Latitude is shown on the y-axis (vertical) and longitude on the x-axis (horizontal).

5. Geographic Boundaries: The map outlines the boundaries of North Carolina counties.

6. City Marker: There is a red star marker indicating the location of Raleigh, the capital city of North Carolina.

7. Data Points: The blue dots scattered across the map represent population density in the various counties.

8. Grid: A coordinate grid is overlaid on the map to help locate specific points based on latitude and longitude.

These elements together provide a visual representation of population distribution across the counties of North Carolina.
