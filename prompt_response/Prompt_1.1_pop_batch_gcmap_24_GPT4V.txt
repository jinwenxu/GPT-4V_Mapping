The map you've provided is a choropleth map, which uses differences in shading or coloring within predefined areas to represent the population density or quantity of a particular phenomenon. Here are the map elements included in the given map:

1. Title: "Choropleth Map of Population in Maryland Counties" at the top of the map, indicating the map's purpose and geographic focus.

2. Color Legend: A box in the lower-left corner that explains the color scheme used to represent different population ranges. It includes five color categories:
   - Light yellow for populations less than 71.4K
   - Yellow for populations between 71.4K and 167.7K
   - Orange for populations between 167.7K and 318.9K
   - Dark orange for populations between 318.9K and 609K
   - Red for populations greater than 609K

3. Latitude and Longitude Markers: Along the borders of the map, there are numerical markers indicating the latitude (on the left and right sides) and longitude (on the bottom) in degrees.

4. County Boundaries: Lines that delineate the borders of the counties within Maryland.

5. Location Marker: A blue dot labeled "Annapolis," indicating the location of the city within the state.

6. Map Scale: There is no explicit numerical scale provided, but the latitude and longitude markers can help to estimate distances.

7. North Arrow: This map does not include a north arrow, but it is common for north to be assumed at the top of the map in the absence of such an indicator.

8. Data Source or Credits: This map does not visibly include a data source or credits, which are often found on maps to indicate the origin of the data used.

9. Border: A thin line that frames the map content.

These elements help the viewer to interpret the data presented, understand the geographic area being represented, and provide context for the information shown on the map.
