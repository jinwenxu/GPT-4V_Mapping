The map you've provided is a dot density map showing the population distribution in Virginia counties. Here are the map elements included in the given map:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Virginia Counties" at the top of the map indicates the subject and geographic area of the map.

2. Legend: In the lower left corner, there is a legend explaining the population representation with different dot densities corresponding to population amounts (1K, 10K, 100K, 1M).

3. Scale: There is no explicit scale bar, but the latitude and longitude grid can serve as a reference for scale.

4. Latitude and Longitude Grid: The grid lines are labeled with latitude and longitude coordinates in degrees, which helps to locate specific areas on the map.

5. County Boundaries: The outlines of the counties in Virginia are depicted, providing a political boundary context.

6. Dot Representation: The dots scattered across the map represent population density, with clusters of dots indicating higher population areas.

7. City Label: The map includes a label for Richmond, indicating a significant location within the state.

8. North Arrow: There is no north arrow, but it is commonly assumed that the top of the map is north unless otherwise indicated.

These elements together provide the viewer with information about the population distribution across the counties of Virginia.
