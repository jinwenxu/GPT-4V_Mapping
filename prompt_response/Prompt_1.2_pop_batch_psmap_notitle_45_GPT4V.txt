The given figure represents a proportional symbol map, which is a type of thematic map. In this map, symbols of different sizes are used to represent data associated with different locations, with the size of the symbol being proportional to the magnitude of the data it represents. In this case, the map is showing population data, with larger circles representing larger populations. The legend in the bottom left corner indicates the population sizes that correspond to the different sizes of the circles.
