The map you've provided includes several key elements that are commonly found in cartographic representations. Here's a list of the map elements included:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Maryland Counties" at the top of the map indicates the subject and geographic area of the map.

2. Legend: In the lower-left corner, there's a legend explaining the dot density representation of population, with different dot sizes corresponding to population amounts (1K, 10K, 100K, 1M).

3. Scale: While there is no graphical scale bar, the latitude and longitude grid can be used to infer distances.

4. Latitude and Longitude Grid: The grid lines are labeled with latitude and longitude values, which helps to locate specific points on the map.

5. Data Points: The blue dots scattered across the map represent population density, with varying sizes according to the legend.

6. Geographic Boundaries: The outlines of Maryland counties are depicted, providing a political boundary context.

7. Point of Interest: The city of Annapolis is marked with a red star and labeled, indicating its location within the state.

8. Axes Labels: The labels "Latitude (°)" and "Longitude (°)" along the y-axis and x-axis respectively, indicating the measurement units for the grid.

These elements combined allow the map to convey information about the population distribution across the counties of Maryland.
