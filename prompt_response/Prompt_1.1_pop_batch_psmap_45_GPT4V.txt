The map provided is a Proportional Symbol Map of Population in South Carolina Counties. The elements included in this map are:

1. Title: "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in South Carolina Counties" at the top of the map, which describes the map's purpose.

2. Symbols: Red circles of varying sizes represent the population in each county. The size of each circle is proportional to the population it represents.

3. Legend: In the bottom left corner, there is a legend that explains the sizes of the red circles corresponding to population amounts: a small dot for 10K (10,000), a larger dot for 50K (50,000), an even larger dot for 100K (100,000), and the largest red circle for 500K (500,000).

4. Labels: The city of Columbia is labeled in blue text, indicating a place of interest or a reference point on the map.

5. Latitude and Longitude: The map has latitude and longitude lines and labels indicating the geographical coordinates. Latitude is shown on the y-axis (vertical) and longitude on the x-axis (horizontal).

6. County Boundaries: The outlines of the counties in South Carolina are drawn on the map, dividing the state into its respective counties.

7. Scale: While there is no explicit scale bar, the latitude and longitude lines can provide a sense of scale based on degrees.

8. Orientation: There is no explicit north arrow, but it is commonly assumed that the top of the map is north unless otherwise indicated.

9. Grid: A grid of latitude and longitude lines helps to locate the counties geographically.

These elements together provide a visual representation of the population distribution across the counties of South Carolina.
