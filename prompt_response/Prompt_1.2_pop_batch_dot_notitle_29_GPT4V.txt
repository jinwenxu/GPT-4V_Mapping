The thematic map presented here is a dot distribution map. This type of map uses dots to represent the presence, quantity, or value of a particular phenomenon. In this case, the map is showing the distribution of population across a geographic area, with different dot sizes representing different population quantities, as indicated by the legend on the bottom left. The larger the dot, the higher the population in that area.
