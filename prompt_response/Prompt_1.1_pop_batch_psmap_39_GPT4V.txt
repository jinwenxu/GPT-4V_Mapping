The map provided is a Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Ohio Counties, and it includes the following elements:

1. Title: "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Ohio Counties" at the top of the map indicates the subject and geographic area represented.

2. Symbols: Red circles of varying sizes represent the population in each county, with larger circles indicating a higher population.

3. Legend: In the lower-left corner, there is a legend explaining the sizes of the circles corresponding to population amounts: a small dot for 10K (10,000 people), a larger circle for 50K (50,000 people), and an even larger circle for 100K (100,000 people). The largest circle represents 500K (500,000 people).

4. Labels: The city of Columbus is labeled with a blue dot and text, indicating its location on the map.

5. Latitude and Longitude: The map includes latitude and longitude lines, with labels on the axes (Latitude on the y-axis and Longitude on the x-axis) to help locate specific points.

6. Scale: While there is no numeric scale bar, the latitude and longitude lines provide a sense of scale.

7. Border Lines: The map shows the borders of Ohio counties, which are outlined and segmented.

8. North Arrow: There is no explicit north arrow, but the orientation is assumed to be standard with north at the top of the map.

These elements together provide a visual representation of the population distribution across the counties of Ohio.
