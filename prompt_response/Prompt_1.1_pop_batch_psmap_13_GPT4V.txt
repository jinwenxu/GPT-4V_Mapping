The map elements included in the given map are:

1. Title: "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Georgia Counties" - This provides the viewer with the subject of the map.

2. Symbols: Red circles of varying sizes - These represent the population in each county, with the size of the circle proportional to the population size.

3. Legend: A box in the lower-left corner that explains the meaning of the symbols - It shows that the smallest dot represents a population of 10K (10,000), a slightly larger dot represents 50K (50,000), an even larger dot represents 100K (100,000), and the largest red circle represents 500K (500,000).

4. Labels: "Atlanta" is labeled with a blue dot and text, indicating a significant location on the map.

5. Latitude and Longitude markers: Along the borders of the map, there are numerical values indicating the latitude (on the y-axis) and longitude (on the x-axis) in degrees.

6. County boundaries: Lines that delineate the borders of the counties within the state of Georgia.

7. Scale: While there is no graphical scale bar, the latitude and longitude markers can be used to infer distances on the map.

8. Orientation: There is no explicit north arrow, but it is conventionally assumed that the top of the map is north.

9. Frame: A border that neatly contains all elements of the map.

These elements work together to convey information about the population distribution across the counties of Georgia.
