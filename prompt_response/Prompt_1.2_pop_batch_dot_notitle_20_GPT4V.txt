The thematic map presented here is a dot distribution map. This type of map uses dots to represent the presence, quantity, or value of a particular phenomenon being mappedâ€”in this case, population. Each dot corresponds to a certain number of people, as indicated by the legend on the map, which shows different dot sizes representing different population quantities (1K for 1,000, 10K for 10,000, 100K for 100,000, and 1M for 1 million). The map is used to visualize the spatial distribution of the population across the geographic area shown, with a higher concentration of dots indicating more densely populated areas.
