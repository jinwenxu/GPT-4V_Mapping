The map provided is a Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Florida Counties, and it includes the following elements:

1. Title: "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Florida Counties" at the top of the map, which describes the map's content and purpose.

2. Symbols: Red circles of varying sizes representing the population of each county. The size of each circle is proportional to the population it represents.

3. Legend: A box in the lower-left corner that explains the meaning of the symbols. It shows four different sizes of red circles with corresponding population values (10K, 50K, 100K, 500K), indicating that the size of the circle is related to the population size.

4. Latitude and Longitude: The map includes latitude and longitude lines, with labels on the axes indicating degrees. Latitude is shown on the y-axis (vertical) and longitude on the x-axis (horizontal).

5. Scale: While there is no explicit scale bar, the latitude and longitude lines provide a geographic scale.

6. Geographic Boundaries: The map outlines the counties in Florida with black boundary lines.

7. Location Marker: There is a blue marker pointing to Tallahassee, indicating the location of the state capital.

8. Grid: A light gray grid in the background helps to visually align the latitude and longitude values.

These elements together provide a visual representation of the population distribution across the counties of Florida.
