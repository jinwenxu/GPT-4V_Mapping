The figure represents a dot distribution map, which is a type of thematic map. This map uses dots to represent the distribution of a particular variable across a geographic areaâ€”in this case, population. Each dot corresponds to a certain number of people, as indicated by the legend in the lower left corner of the map. The concentration of dots gives a visual indication of population density in different areas, with more densely populated areas having a higher concentration of dots. The map focuses on a specific region with the city of Little Rock labeled, suggesting that the area depicted is likely in the state of Arkansas, USA.
