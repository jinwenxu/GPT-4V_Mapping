The map you've provided is a dot density map of population in Florida counties. Here are the map elements included:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Florida Counties" at the top of the map.
2. Legend: A box in the lower left corner that explains the population density represented by dots:
   - A small square labeled "1K" for 1,000 people.
   - A larger square labeled "10K" for 10,000 people.
   - An even larger square filled with blue dots labeled "100K" for 100,000 people.
   - A solid blue square labeled "1M" for 1 million people.
3. Latitude and Longitude markers: Along the borders of the map, indicating the geographic coordinates.
   - Latitude markers on the left side of the map (Y-axis) ranging from 25째 to 31째.
   - Longitude markers on the bottom of the map (X-axis) ranging from -88째 to -80째.
4. Scale: While there is no explicit scale bar, the latitude and longitude markers can be used to infer distances.
5. County boundaries: Outlined on the map to show the different counties in Florida.
6. Dot representation: Various dots spread across the map indicating the population density in different areas.
7. Location marker: A red marker indicating the city of Tallahassee.

These elements together provide a visual representation of the population distribution across the counties of Florida.
