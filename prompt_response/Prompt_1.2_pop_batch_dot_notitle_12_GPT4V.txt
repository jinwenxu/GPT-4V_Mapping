The figure you've provided is a dot distribution map, which is a type of thematic map. This particular map represents population distribution, where each dot corresponds to a certain number of people as indicated in the legend. The legend shows that different dot sizes represent different population quantities: small dots for 1,000 people, medium dots for 10,000 people, and large dots for 1,000,000 people.
