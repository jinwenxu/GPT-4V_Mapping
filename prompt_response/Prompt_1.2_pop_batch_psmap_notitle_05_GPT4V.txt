The thematic map provided is a proportional symbol map. This type of map uses symbols, such as circles in this case, of different sizes to represent data quantities and show the distribution and relative magnitude of some spatial phenomenon. Here, the circles represent population sizes in different locations, with larger circles indicating larger populations. The legend on the bottom left corner indicates the scale for the population sizes corresponding to the symbol sizes (10K for small dots, 50K for medium, 100K for larger, and 500K for the largest red dot).
