The given figure represents a dot distribution map, which is a type of thematic map. This map uses dots to represent the presence, quantity, or value of a particular geographic phenomenon. In this case, the map is showing the distribution of population across a region, with different-sized dots corresponding to different population quantities as indicated in the legend. The legend shows that small dots represent a population of 1,000 (1K), slightly larger dots represent 10,000 (10K), and the largest dots represent 100,000 (100K). There is also a category for 1 million (1M), but it does not appear to be represented on the map. The map is focused on a specific area with latitude and longitude coordinates provided, and it includes a reference to the city of Jackson, which is likely a significant urban center in the region depicted.
