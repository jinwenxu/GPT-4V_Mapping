The map you've provided is a Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Missouri Counties. Here are the map elements included:

1. Title: "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Missouri Counties" at the top of the map, which describes the map's purpose.

2. Symbols: Red circles of varying sizes representing the population of each county. The size of each circle corresponds to the population size.

3. Legend: Located in the bottom left corner, it explains the meaning of the symbols' sizes with a reference to population numbers (10K for small dots, 50K for medium dots, 100K for larger dots, and 500K for the largest dot).

4. Scale: There is no explicit scale bar, but latitude and longitude are provided as a reference for scale.

5. Latitude and Longitude markers: Along the borders of the map, indicating the geographic coordinates.

6. County boundaries: Outlined to show the individual counties within Missouri.

7. Highlighted city: "Jefferson City" is marked with a blue dot and labeled, indicating the state capital or a city of interest.

8. Grid: A coordinate grid overlaying the map, which helps to locate the counties using latitude and longitude.

The map does not include a north arrow, which is often found on maps to indicate direction, but since this is a standard map projection with north at the top, it may not be deemed necessary by the map's creator.
