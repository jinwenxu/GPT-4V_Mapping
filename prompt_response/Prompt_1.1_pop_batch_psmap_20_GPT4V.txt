The map provided is a Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Kansas Counties, and it includes the following elements:

1. Title: The title "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Kansas Counties" is at the top of the map, indicating the subject and geographic area represented.

2. Symbols: The map uses proportional symbols (circles of varying sizes) to represent the population of each county. The size of each circle corresponds to the population size of the county it represents.

3. Legend: There is a legend in the lower left corner that explains the sizes of the circles in relation to the population. It shows four different circle sizes corresponding to populations of 10K (10,000), 50K (50,000), 100K (100,000), and 500K (500,000).

4. Latitude and Longitude: The map includes latitude and longitude lines, with labels on the axes indicating degrees. Latitude is shown on the y-axis (vertical) and longitude on the x-axis (horizontal).

5. Scale: While there is no explicit scale bar, the latitude and longitude lines provide a geographic scale that can be used to estimate distances.

6. City Marker: There is a label for Topeka, the capital city of Kansas, marked with a blue dot, which is distinct from the red proportional symbols used for county populations.

7. County Boundaries: The map shows the boundaries of the counties in Kansas.

8. Grid: A grid overlay is present, corresponding to the latitude and longitude lines, which helps in locating the counties and interpreting the map.

These elements together provide the information necessary to interpret the population distribution across the counties of Kansas.
