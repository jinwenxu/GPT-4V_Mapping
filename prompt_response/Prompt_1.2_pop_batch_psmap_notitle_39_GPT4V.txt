The given figure represents a proportional symbol map, which is a type of thematic map. In this map, the size of the symbol (in this case, circles) varies in proportion to the magnitude of the data represented in different areas. The map is showing population data, with larger circles representing larger populations. The legend on the bottom left indicates the scale of population sizes corresponding to the circle sizes, with the smallest dot representing 10,000 people and the largest representing 500,000 people.
