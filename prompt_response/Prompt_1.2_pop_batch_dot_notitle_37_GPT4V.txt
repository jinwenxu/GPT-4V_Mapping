The thematic map provided appears to be a dot distribution map, which is used to represent the presence of a feature or phenomenon. Dot maps use dots to indicate the occurrence of something and are often used to show the distribution of population density, as is the case here. Each dot represents a certain number of people, as indicated by the legend on the map, which shows different dot sizes corresponding to population quantities such as 1K (1,000), 10K (10,000), 100K (100,000), and 1M (1,000,000). The map shows the geographic distribution of population in the depicted area, with the city of Raleigh labeled, indicating a higher concentration of population in that region.
