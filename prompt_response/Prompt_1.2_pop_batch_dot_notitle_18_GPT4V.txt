The thematic map provided appears to be a dot distribution map, also known as a dot density map. This type of map uses dots to represent the presence, quantity, or value of a particular geographic phenomenon. In this case, each dot represents a certain number of people, as indicated by the legend in the lower-left corner, which shows the population scale with different dot sizes corresponding to population quantities such as 1K (1,000 people), 10K (10,000 people), 100K (100,000 people), and 1M (1 million people). The map is used to visualize the population distribution across the geographic area shown, with a higher concentration of dots indicating more densely populated areas.
