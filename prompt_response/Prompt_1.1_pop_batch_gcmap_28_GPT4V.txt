The map provided is a choropleth map showing the population distribution across counties in Mississippi. The elements included in this map are:

1. Title: "Choropleth Map of Population in Mississippi Counties" at the top of the map.
2. Legend: A color-coded legend indicating the population ranges, with different shades representing different population brackets:
   - Light yellow for "< 22.0K" (less than 22,000)
   - Yellow for "22.0K - 49.5K" (22,000 to 49,500)
   - Light orange for "49.5K - 104.6K" (49,500 to 104,600)
   - Orange for "104.6K - 179.0K" (104,600 to 179,000)
   - Dark red for "> 179.0K" (greater than 179,000)
3. Labels: The name "Jackson" is labeled on the map, indicating the location of a significant area, presumably the city of Jackson, which is the capital of Mississippi.
4. Latitude and Longitude: The map includes latitude and longitude lines, with labels on the left and bottom edges of the map, respectively.
5. Color Coding: The counties are filled with colors corresponding to the population ranges indicated in the legend.
6. Borders: The map shows the borders of the counties within Mississippi.
7. Scale: While there is no explicit scale bar, the latitude and longitude lines can provide a sense of scale.

The map does not include a north arrow, which is often found on maps to indicate direction, but given the grid of latitude and longitude, the top of the map can be assumed to be north.
