The map you've provided is a choropleth map showing the population distribution across counties in Texas. Here are the map elements included in the given map:

1. Title: "Choropleth Map of Population in Texas Counties" at the top of the map, indicating the map's subject.

2. Legend: A color-coded legend in the bottom left corner, explaining the population ranges associated with different colors:
   - Light yellow: Population less than 173.8K
   - Medium yellow: Population between 173.8K and 571.9K
   - Orange: Population between 571.9K and 1.2M
   - Red: Population between 1.2M and 2.6M
   - Dark red: Population greater than 2.6M

3. Labels: The map has a label "Austin" indicating the location of the city of Austin, Texas.

4. Latitude and Longitude: The map is marked with latitude and longitude lines, with labels on the axes indicating degrees in latitude (vertical axis) and longitude (horizontal axis).

5. Color Coding: The counties are filled with colors corresponding to their population range as indicated in the legend.

6. Borders: The map shows the borders of the individual counties within Texas.

7. Scale: While there is no explicit scale bar, the latitude and longitude markers can provide a sense of scale.

8. Orientation: There is no explicit north arrow, but the map is oriented in the standard north-up orientation, which can be inferred from the latitude and longitude grid.

These elements together provide information about the population distribution in a visual format, allowing for easy comparison between different regions within Texas.
