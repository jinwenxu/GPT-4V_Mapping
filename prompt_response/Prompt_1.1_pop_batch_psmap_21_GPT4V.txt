The map provided is a Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Kentucky Counties. The elements included in this map are:

1. Title: "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Kentucky Counties" at the top of the map, which describes the map's purpose.

2. Symbols: Red circles of varying sizes represent the population in each county. The size of each circle is proportional to the population it represents.

3. Legend: A box in the lower left corner explains the sizes of the red circles corresponding to different population amounts: a small dot for 10K (10,000), a larger dot for 50K (50,000), an even larger dot for 100K (100,000), and the largest dot for 500K (500,000).

4. Geographic Coordinates: Latitude and longitude lines are marked along the borders of the map, with latitude on the y-axis (vertical) and longitude on the x-axis (horizontal).

5. County Boundaries: Outlines of the counties in Kentucky are drawn on the map.

6. City Marker: A blue dot with a label "Frankfort" indicates the location of the city of Frankfort, which is the capital of Kentucky.

These elements together provide a visual representation of the population distribution across the counties of Kentucky.
