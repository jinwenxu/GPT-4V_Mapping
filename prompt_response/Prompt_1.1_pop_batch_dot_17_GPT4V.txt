The map elements included in the given dot density map of population in Illinois counties are:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Illinois Counties" at the top of the map.
2. Legend: A box in the lower left corner that explains the population density represented by different symbols:
   - A light gray square labeled "1K" for 1,000 people.
   - A darker gray square labeled "10K" for 10,000 people.
   - A blue square with dots labeled "100K" for 100,000 people.
   - A solid blue square labeled "1M" for 1 million people.
3. Scale: There is no explicit scale bar, but latitude and longitude lines suggest the geographic scale.
4. Latitude and Longitude markers: Along the borders of the map, indicating the degrees of latitude (vertical) and longitude (horizontal).
5. County boundaries: Outlined areas that show the borders of the counties within Illinois.
6. Dots: Representing the population density within each county, with the density of dots corresponding to the number of people as indicated in the legend.
7. Location marker: A red marker labeled "Springfield," indicating the location of the city of Springfield within the state.
8. The map's border: A rectangular border framing the map content.

The map uses a dot density approach to visually represent population distribution across the counties of Illinois, with denser clusters of dots indicating higher population areas.
