The map provided is a "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Louisiana Counties." Here are the map elements included:

1. Title: The title at the top of the map clearly states the purpose of the map, which is to show the population distribution across Louisiana counties using proportional symbols.

2. Symbols: The map uses red circular symbols of varying sizes to represent the population in each county. The size of each symbol is proportional to the population it represents.

3. Legend: In the bottom left corner, there is a legend that explains the meaning of the symbols' sizes. It correlates specific sizes with population amounts: a small dot for 10K (10,000 people), a larger dot for 50K (50,000 people), an even larger dot for 100K (100,000 people), and a very large dot for 500K (500,000 people).

4. Scale: The map does not have a traditional scale bar, but the latitude and longitude grid can be used to estimate distances and scale.

5. Latitude and Longitude Grid: The map includes a grid with latitude and longitude lines marked in degrees. Latitude lines are horizontal, and longitude lines are vertical.

6. Place Names: The map includes the name "Baton Rouge," which is the capital city of Louisiana, labeled with a blue pointer to indicate its location.

7. County Boundaries: The map shows the boundaries of the counties in Louisiana with black lines.

8. Coastline: The map depicts the irregular coastline of Louisiana along the Gulf of Mexico.

These elements together provide a visual representation of the population distribution across the counties of Louisiana.
