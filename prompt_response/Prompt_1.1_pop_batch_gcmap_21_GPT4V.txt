The map provided is a choropleth map showing the population distribution across Kentucky counties. Here are the map elements included in the given map:

1. Title: "Choropleth Map of Population in Kentucky Counties" at the top of the map.
2. Legend: A color-coded legend in the bottom left corner indicating the population ranges with corresponding colors:
   - Light yellow for "< 31.4K" (less than 31,400)
   - Yellow for "31.4K - 80.2K" (31,400 to 80,200)
   - Light orange for "80.2K - 165.7K" (80,200 to 165,700)
   - Orange for "165.7K - 320.6K" (165,700 to 320,600)
   - Dark red for "> 320.6K" (greater than 320,600)
3. County Boundaries: Outlines of the counties in Kentucky.
4. Color Coding: Counties are filled with colors corresponding to their population range as indicated in the legend.
5. Latitude and Longitude Markers: Along the borders of the map, there are numerical markers indicating latitude (degrees) on the left and right sides and longitude (degrees) on the bottom.
6. Point of Interest: The city of Frankfort is marked with a blue dot and labeled.
7. Scale: There is no explicit scale bar, but latitude and longitude markers can provide a sense of scale.

The map does not include a north arrow, which is often found on maps to indicate direction, but given the grid of latitude and longitude, the top of the map can be assumed to be north.
