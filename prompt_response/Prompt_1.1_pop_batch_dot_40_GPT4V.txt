The map you've provided is a dot density map representing population distribution in Oklahoma counties. Here are the map elements included:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Oklahoma Counties" at the top of the map, indicating the map's subject and geographic focus.

2. Legend: In the lower-left corner, there is a legend explaining the population density represented by dots. Each dot represents a certain number of people:
   - A single dot for 1K (1,000 people)
   - A cluster of dots for 10K (10,000 people)
   - A denser cluster for 100K (100,000 people)
   - A very dense cluster for 1M (1,000,000 people)

3. Scale: There is no explicit scale bar, but the latitude and longitude grid can serve as a reference for scale.

4. Latitude and Longitude Labels: Along the borders of the map, there are labels for latitude (on the y-axis) and longitude (on the x-axis), measured in degrees.

5. County Boundaries: The map shows the boundaries of the counties in Oklahoma.

6. City Label: There is a label for "Oklahoma City," indicating a significant urban area on the map.

7. Dot Representation: The map uses blue dots to represent the population density within each county.

8. Geographic Coordinates: The map is framed by lines of latitude and longitude, creating a grid that helps to locate specific areas.

These elements together provide a visual representation of how the population is distributed across the counties of Oklahoma, with denser populations indicated by a higher concentration of dots.
