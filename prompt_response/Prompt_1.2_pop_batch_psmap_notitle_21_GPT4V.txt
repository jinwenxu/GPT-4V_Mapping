The given figure represents a proportional symbol map, which is a type of thematic map. In this map, symbols of varying sizes are used to represent data associated with different locations. The size of each symbol corresponds to the magnitude of the attribute being depicted, which in this case is population. The legend in the lower left corner indicates the population sizes that correspond to the different symbol sizes, ranging from 10K (10,000) to 500K (500,000). This type of map is useful for quickly visualizing the relative population distribution across the geographic area shown.
