The thematic map provided is a proportional symbol map. This type of map uses symbols, such as circles in this case, of different sizes to represent quantitative values of a particular theme, which in this map is population size. The legend on the bottom left indicates the scale of population sizes that each symbol size represents, with smaller dots for populations of 10K (10,000) and larger dots for populations of 500K (500,000). The map shows the distribution of population across different locations within the state, with the larger symbols indicating more populous areas.
