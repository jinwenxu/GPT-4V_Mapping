The map provided is a dot density map showing the population distribution in Georgia counties. The elements included in this map are:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Georgia Counties" at the top of the map, which describes the map's content.
2. Dots: Representing the population, with different dot sizes indicating different population quantities.
3. Legend: Located in the lower-left corner, explaining the meaning of the dot sizes:
   - A small square labeled "1K" for 1,000 people.
   - A slightly larger square labeled "10K" for 10,000 people.
   - An even larger square labeled "100K" for 100,000 people.
   - The largest square labeled "1M" for 1 million people.
4. County Boundaries: Outlined to show the different counties within Georgia.
5. Latitude and Longitude: Marked on the axes to indicate the geographical coordinates.
6. Scale: Not explicitly shown with a scale bar, but the latitude and longitude can be used to infer distances.
7. City Marker: A red marker labeled "Atlanta" indicating the location of Atlanta within the map.
8. Color Coding: The dots are colored blue, likely to enhance visibility against the white background of the map.

The map does not appear to have a north arrow, which is often included to indicate map orientation, nor does it have a scale bar to give a precise indication of distances. However, the latitude and longitude markers can help users approximate distances and orientation.
