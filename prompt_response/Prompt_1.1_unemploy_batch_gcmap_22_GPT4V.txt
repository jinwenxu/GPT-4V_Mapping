   - Red: > 10.64%
3. Latitude and Longitude Markers: Along the borders of the map, indicating the geographical coordinates.
4. Scale: The map does not have a numerical scale bar, but the latitude and longitude markers can help estimate distances.
5. Location Marker: A blue dot labeled "Baton Rouge," indicating the location of the city within the state.
6. County Boundaries: Outlines of the counties within Louisiana, each filled with a color corresponding to the unemployment rate according to the legend.
