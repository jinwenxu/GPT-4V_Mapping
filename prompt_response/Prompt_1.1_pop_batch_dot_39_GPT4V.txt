The map provided is a dot density map representing population in Ohio counties. The elements included in this map are:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Ohio Counties" at the top of the map.
2. Legend: A box in the lower left corner indicating the population density, where one dot represents a certain number of people:
   - Black square for 1K (1,000 people)
   - Dark blue square for 10K (10,000 people)
   - Light blue square for 100K (100,000 people)
   - A larger blue area for 1M (1,000,000 people)
3. Labels: The name "Columbus" is labeled on the map, indicating the location of the city.
4. Scale: The map uses latitude and longitude lines as a reference for scale, with latitude on the y-axis and longitude on the x-axis.
5. Dots: Representing the population density in different counties, with varying concentrations of dots.
6. County Boundaries: Outlines of counties are visible, providing a framework for the distribution of the population data.
7. Axes Labels: "Latitude (°)" on the y-axis and "Longitude (°)" on the x-axis.
8. Axes Values: Numerical values indicating degrees of latitude and longitude along the axes.
9. North Arrow: There is a small north arrow in the upper right corner, indicating the orientation of the map.

These elements together provide a visual representation of the population distribution across the counties of Ohio.
