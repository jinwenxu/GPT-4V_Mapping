The map you've provided is a dot density map showing the population distribution in Louisiana counties. Here are the map elements included:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Louisiana Counties" at the top, indicating the map's purpose.
2. Legend: In the lower-left corner, explaining the population density represented by dots:
   - A small square with one dot labeled "1K" (representing 1,000 people)
   - A larger square with multiple dots labeled "10K" (representing 10,000 people)
   - An even larger square densely filled with dots labeled "100K" (representing 100,000 people)
   - A solid blue square labeled "1M" (representing 1 million people)
3. Scale: Not explicitly shown as a graphical scale bar, but the latitude and longitude grid can be used to estimate distances.
4. Latitude and Longitude markers: Along the borders of the map, indicating the geographical coordinates.
5. County boundaries: Outlined to show the different counties within Louisiana.
6. City marker: A red dot labeled "Baton Rouge," indicating the location of this city on the map.
7. Dots representing population: Various dots scattered across the map, with their density corresponding to the population in each area as per the legend.

Please note that while the map provides a visual representation of population distribution, it does not include some common elements such as a north arrow, a scale bar, or a source citation for the data.
