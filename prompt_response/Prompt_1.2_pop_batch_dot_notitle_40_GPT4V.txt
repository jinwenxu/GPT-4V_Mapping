The figure represents a dot distribution map, which is a type of thematic map. This map uses dots to represent the distribution of a particular variable across a geographic areaâ€”in this case, the population. Each dot corresponds to a certain number of people, as indicated by the legend in the lower left corner of the map. The concentration of dots gives a visual indication of population density in different areas, with urban centers like Oklahoma City showing a much higher concentration of dots, and thus a higher population density, compared to rural areas.
