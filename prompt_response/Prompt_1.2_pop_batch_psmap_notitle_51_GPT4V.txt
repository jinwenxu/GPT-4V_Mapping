The given figure represents a proportional symbol map, which is a type of thematic map. In this map, symbols of different sizes are used to represent data associated with different locations, with the size of the symbol corresponding to the magnitude of the data it represents. In this case, the map is showing population data, with varying sizes of circles indicating different population levels in the locations marked on the map. The legend in the bottom left corner provides a key to the sizes of the circles, correlating them with specific population counts (e.g., 10K, 50K, 100K, 500K).
