The given figure represents a proportional symbol map, which is a type of thematic map. In this map, symbols of varying sizes are used to represent data associated with different locations. The size of each symbol reflects the magnitude of the attribute being mappedâ€”in this case, population. The legend on the left side of the map indicates the population sizes corresponding to the different symbol sizes, ranging from 10K (10,000) to 500K (500,000).
