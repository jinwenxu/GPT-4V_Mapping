The map provided is a Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Virginia Counties, and it includes the following elements:

1. Title: "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Virginia Counties" at the top of the map, indicating the map's purpose and geographic focus.

2. Symbols: Red circles of varying sizes representing the population of each county. The size of each circle corresponds to the population size, with larger circles indicating larger populations.

3. Legend: A box in the lower left corner that explains the meaning of the symbols. It shows four different circle sizes with corresponding population numbers: a small dot for 10K (10,000), a slightly larger circle for 50K (50,000), an even larger circle for 100K (100,000), and a large red circle for 500K (500,000).

4. Geographic Boundaries: Outlines of Virginia counties, which provide a framework for the location of the population symbols.

5. Latitude and Longitude: Graticule lines and labels along the borders of the map indicating latitude (degrees north) and longitude (degrees west).

6. Place Name: The name "Richmond" is labeled on the map, indicating the location of this particular city within Virginia.

7. Scale: There is no explicit scale bar, but the latitude and longitude markers can provide a sense of scale.

8. Orientation: There is no explicit north arrow, but it is commonly assumed that the top of the map is north unless otherwise indicated.

These elements together provide a visual representation of population distribution across the counties of Virginia.
