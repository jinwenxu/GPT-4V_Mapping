The figure represents a proportional symbol map, which is a type of thematic map. In this map, symbols of different sizes are used to represent data associated with different areas or locations, with the size of the symbol being proportional to the magnitude of the variable being represented. In this case, the variable is population, and the size of the red dots corresponds to the population size in different areas, as indicated by the legend on the bottom left of the map.
