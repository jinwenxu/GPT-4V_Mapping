The thematic map provided appears to be a dot distribution map, which is used to represent the presence of a feature or phenomenon. In this case, the map is showing the population distribution within a certain area, with dots of varying sizes representing different population quantities. The legend in the bottom left corner indicates the scale, with different dot sizes corresponding to population sizes of 1K (1,000), 10K (10,000), 100K (100,000), and 1M (1,000,000) people. The map is focused on a region with Atlanta at its center, and the distribution of dots illustrates how population density varies across the area.
