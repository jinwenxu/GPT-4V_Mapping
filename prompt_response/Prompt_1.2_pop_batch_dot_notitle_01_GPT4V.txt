The thematic map provided appears to be a dot distribution map, which is used to represent the spatial distribution of a particular variable, in this case, population. Each dot on the map represents a certain number of people, as indicated by the legend in the lower left corner. The legend shows different dot sizes corresponding to population quantities such as 1K (1,000 people), 10K (10,000 people), 100K (100,000 people), and 1M (1 million people). The map is focused on a specific geographic area, with latitude and longitude lines providing a reference grid. The city of Montgomery is highlighted, suggesting that it may be a significant location in the context of the data being presented.
