The given figure represents a proportional symbol map, which is a type of thematic map. In this map, symbols of varying sizes are used to represent data associated with different locations. The size of each symbol corresponds to the magnitude of the attribute being depictedâ€”in this case, population size. The legend in the lower left corner indicates the scale of population sizes that each symbol size represents, with larger circles representing larger populations.
