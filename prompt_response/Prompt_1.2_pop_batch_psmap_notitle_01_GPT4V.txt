The given figure represents a proportional symbol map, which is a type of thematic map. In this map, symbols of varying sizes are used to represent data associated with different locations, with the size of the symbol corresponding to the magnitude of the data it represents. In this case, the map is using circles of different sizes to indicate population levels in various areas, with larger circles representing larger populations. The legend in the bottom left corner provides a key to the population sizes associated with the different circle sizes, ranging from 10K (10,000) to 500K (500,000).
