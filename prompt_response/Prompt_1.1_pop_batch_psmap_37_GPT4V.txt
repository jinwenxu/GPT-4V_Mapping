The map you've provided includes several key elements that are commonly found in thematic maps. Here's a list of the map elements included:

1. Title: "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in North Carolina Counties" - This provides the viewer with the subject and geographic area of the map.

2. Symbols: Red circles of varying sizes - These represent the population of the counties in North Carolina, with larger circles indicating larger populations.

3. Legend: A box in the lower left corner that explains the meaning of the symbols - It shows different-sized red circles next to population numbers (10K, 50K, 100K, 500K), indicating the population each circle size represents.

4. Scale: There is no explicit numeric or graphic scale provided, but the latitude and longitude grid can help to estimate distances.

5. Latitude and Longitude Grid: The grid lines are marked with degrees of latitude and longitude, which helps to locate specific areas on the map.

6. Geographic Features: The map outlines the counties in North Carolina.

7. City Marker: A blue circle with a label "Raleigh" - This indicates the location of Raleigh, the capital city of North Carolina.

These elements together help the viewer to interpret the data presented on the map, which in this case is the population distribution across the counties of North Carolina.
