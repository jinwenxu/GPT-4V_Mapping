The thematic map provided appears to be a proportional symbol map. This type of map uses symbols of different sizes to represent data associated with different areas or locations within the map. In this case, the varying sizes of the red dots likely represent different population levels, with larger dots indicating larger populations. The legend in the lower left corner confirms this by showing that the smallest dot represents a population of 10K (10,000), a medium dot represents 50K (50,000), and the largest dot represents 500K (500,000). The map is also overlaid with a hexagonal grid, which might be used for spatial analysis or to aggregate data within each hexagon.
