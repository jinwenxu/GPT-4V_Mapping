The map provided is a Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Maryland Counties. The elements included in this map are:

1. Title: "Proportional Symbol Map of Population in Maryland Counties" at the top of the map indicates the map's purpose and geographic focus.

2. Symbols: Red circles of varying sizes represent the population in different counties. The size of each circle is proportional to the population it represents.

3. Legend: A box in the lower left corner explains the meaning of the symbols, with circles of different sizes labeled with corresponding population numbers (10K, 50K, 100K, 500K).

4. Geographic Boundaries: Outlines of Maryland counties are drawn to show the political boundaries within the state.

5. Latitude and Longitude Grid: The grid lines and labels indicate the latitude and longitude in degrees, helping to locate specific points on the map.

6. City Label: The name "Annapolis" is labeled, indicating the location of a significant city within the state.

7. Color Coding: One of the circles is filled with blue instead of red, possibly indicating a special case or different data classification, although there is no legend entry explaining this color difference.

8. Scale: While there is no explicit scale bar, the latitude and longitude grid can be used to estimate distances.

9. Orientation: There is no explicit north arrow, but it is commonly assumed that the top of the map is north unless otherwise indicated.

These elements together provide information about the population distribution across Maryland counties, with the visual aid of proportional symbols to facilitate comparison.
