The thematic map shown in the figure is a proportional symbol map. This type of map uses symbols, such as circles in this case, of different sizes to represent data quantities and show a statistical variable in proportion to the size of the symbol. The map legend indicates that the size of the circles corresponds to the population of the areas, with larger circles representing larger populations.
