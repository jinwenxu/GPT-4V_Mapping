The thematic map provided is a proportional symbol map. This type of map uses symbols, such as circles in this case, of different sizes to represent data quantities and show a thematic variation across a geographic area. The size of each symbol correlates with the magnitude of the data represented, which in this map is the population of different locations. The legend in the lower left corner indicates the scale for the population sizes corresponding to the symbol sizes, ranging from 10K (10,000) to 500K (500,000).
