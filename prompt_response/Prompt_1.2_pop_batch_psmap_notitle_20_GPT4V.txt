The thematic map provided is a type of dot distribution map. This map uses dots to represent the distribution of a particular variable across a geographic areaâ€”in this case, population. The size of the dots corresponds to the population size in different locations, with a legend provided to indicate what population numbers the different dot sizes represent. For example, the smallest dots represent a population of 10,000, while the largest dots represent a population of 500,000. This type of map is useful for visualizing the spatial pattern of a variable such as population density across a region.
