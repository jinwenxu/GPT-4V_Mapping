The thematic map provided appears to be a dot distribution map, also known as a dot density map. This type of map uses dots to represent the presence, quantity, or value of a particular geographic phenomenon. In this case, each dot represents a certain number of people, as indicated by the legend in the lower left corner, which shows different dot sizes corresponding to population quantities (1K, 10K, 100K, 1M). The map is used to visualize the distribution and density of the population across the geographic area depicted, with the concentration of dots giving an impression of more densely populated areas versus sparsely populated ones.
