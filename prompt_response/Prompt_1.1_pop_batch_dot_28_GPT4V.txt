The map elements included in the given dot density map of population in Mississippi counties are:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Mississippi Counties" at the top of the map.
2. Legend: A box in the lower left corner labeled "Population" with symbols indicating the population density scale:
   - A single dot represents 1K (1,000 people).
   - A cluster of dots represents 10K (10,000 people).
   - A larger cluster of dots represents 100K (100,000 people).
   - The largest cluster of dots represents 1M (1,000,000 people).
3. Scale: There is no explicit scale bar, but the map uses latitude and longitude as a reference, which can be used to infer scale.
4. Latitude and Longitude: Marked on the axes of the map with degrees (°) indicating the geographic coordinates.
   - Latitude (vertical axis) ranges approximately from 30° to 35°.
   - Longitude (horizontal axis) ranges approximately from -91.5° to -88.0°.
5. County Boundaries: Outlined shapes that represent the borders of the counties in Mississippi.
6. City Marker: A red marker indicating the location of Jackson, the capital city of Mississippi.
7. Dots: Representing the population distribution within the counties.

The map does not appear to have a north arrow, which is often included in maps to indicate orientation. However, the standard orientation with north at the top is likely assumed.
