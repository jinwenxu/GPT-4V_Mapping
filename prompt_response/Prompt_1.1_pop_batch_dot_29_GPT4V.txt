The map you've provided is a dot density map showing the population distribution in Missouri counties. Here are the map elements included:

1. Title: "Dot Density Map of Population in Missouri Counties" at the top of the map.
2. Legend: In the lower left corner, indicating the population density with different dot sizes representing 1K (1,000), 10K (10,000), 100K (100,000), and 1M (1,000,000) people.
3. Scale: There is no explicit scale bar, but the dot sizes in the legend imply relative population densities.
4. Latitude and Longitude markers: Along the borders of the map, indicating the geographic coordinates.
5. County boundaries: Outlined areas defining the counties within Missouri.
6. Data points (dots): Representing the population density within each county.
7. A label for "Jefferson City," indicating the location of Missouri's capital city on the map.

The map does not appear to have a north arrow, which is often included to indicate map orientation. Additionally, there is no source or date provided to give context for the data's origin or the time frame it represents.
